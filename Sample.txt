# comment - This is not (currently) a file used in the creation of the program just a descriptor currently of what input I used to test the program
# comment - The test I used was essentially as a simple die roller.

number of elements: 6
element 0: 1
element 1: 2
element 2: 3
element 3: 4
element 4: 5
element 5: 6

# Generated 10 then 16 outputs
# note: To make it D12, for example, make number of elements to 12 and keep adding list elements to element 11 (which should be the number 12)
# note: so in xDy (like 3D10) x becomes number of generated outputs and y becomes the number of elements
